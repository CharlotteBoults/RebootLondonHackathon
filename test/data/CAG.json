    "mortgage": "Mortgages Agreement in Principle An Agreement in Principle will help you search for a property in your price range. It may also help you negotiate a better price with the seller because they know you can get a loan. An Agreement in Principle, also known as a 'Decision in Principle' or 'Mortgage Promise', is useful if you haven’t found a property you want to buy but would like to know how much you could borrow. All we need is a few personal details about you and anyone else who will be named on the mortgage. Then we will contact a credit reference agency for a soft credit check and give you a credit score. If you reach our pass mark, we will give you a certificate so that you can show the seller you can get a loan. Soft credit checks do not affect your credit rating or ability to borrow from lenders in the future. Soft credit checks are not seen by other lenders and can only be seen by you on your credit report. While we aim to lend you the amount agreed in principle, sometimes we may not be able to lend you as much as this if: Any of the details you give us change; We have been unable to confirm the information you gave us; Anything about you has changed at the credit reference agency when we make a full loan application search at the time you apply; or Following our discussion with you about your needs and circumstances, we find that we do not have a suitable mortgage for you. We will base our Agreement in Principle on the maximum loan we think you can afford. It will not take into account the type of property you eventually buy or if you buy under certain Schemes such as Help to Buy. Sometimes the amount we are prepared to lend may change depending on the property you choose. This is because we expect you to put down a bigger deposit on some types of properties.   Property types We will consider lending you money to buy different types of old and new property, purpose-built flats or conversions, or a property you are buying outright or under an approved shared ownership or shared equity scheme. We will also consider an application to buy a property that you want to rent out to someone else. We may ask you to provide a bigger deposit on some types of property than others. Any loan we make will be subject to a satisfactory property valuation by a surveyor of our choice. Freehold If the property is freehold, then you will own the property and the land it is built on. We do not lend on freehold flats in England and Wales or Northern Ireland. Leasehold If the property is leasehold, then you will own a temporary right to occupy the property and the land it is built on. The property and the land are owned by someone else and they lease them to you for a number of years. Leases can last for decades or centuries. There is usually an annual charge for the lease, called a ground rent and sometimes there may also be service charges. We will only lend on leasehold properties with at least 70 years left on the lease when you apply. Before you buy, your conveyancer will check the lease terms to make sure they are acceptable. In Scotland (except in rare cases where there is a form of long lease known as a 'tack') all properties are owned outright by the 'registered proprietor'. New build or converted properties A new property or a property that has been built or converted within the last ten years should be part of a Building Standards indemnity scheme. This gives a ten-year warranty against material defects. There are a number of acceptable schemes, but the main one is run by the National House-Building Council (NHBC). We will consider lending on properties that are not part of one of these schemes if it comprises of a development of no more than 15 properties and meets our current monitoring requirements. Help to Buy Lloyds Bank supports a range of government backed initiatives to help people buy a home. For more information, you can speak to one of our mortgage advisers. Or visit the government website. Shared equity This can take various forms. Usually you own 100% of the property but pay a reduced amount to the builder, for example 75% of the property value. You own 100% of the property so there is no rent to pay. The builder holds a 25% stake in the property and registers this interest in your property at the Land Registry. At a later date, when you can afford to, you can buy the remaining 25% from the builder at a cost of 25% of the property's value at that time. If you decide to sell the property, you must give the builder 25% of the sale proceeds. Shared ownership Shared ownership schemes are usually offered by registered social landlords or local authorities. With this type of purchase you buy a share of a property, say half, and pay a reduced rent for the rest to the registered social landlord or the local authority. The share you first buy may be as little as 25%, but if you wish you can buy more shares later until you own the property outright. Right to Buy If you rent your home from your local authority or a registered social landlord, you may have the Right to Buy your home under certain conditions set out by your landlord. You may be able to buy your home at a discount to its market valuation. The discount is usually based on the property value and how long you have been a tenant. Buy to let A buy to let mortgage is a loan you can take out to buy an investment property that you or your family won’t live in and that you intend to rent out to tenants. Taking out a mortgage is one of the many risks of investing in buy to let properties. So before you enter the market you should be an experienced house buyer and have fully researched investment properties. These mortgages aren't available to first time buyers or applicants under the age of twenty five. At least one person named on the loan must currently own a property in the UK. Whether you are starting or expanding your property portfolio, we are here to help you get the right mortgage deal with our range of buy-to-let mortgage products.  Repayment methods There are three different ways of repaying your loan. These are repayment, interest-only, and a combination of repayment and interest-only. Repayment Every month, your payments go towards reducing the amount you owe as well as paying off the interest (see Figure 1). This means that each month you are paying off a small part of your loan. Your annual statement will show your loan getting smaller. However, in the early years your monthly payments will mainly go towards paying off the interest, so the amount you owe won’t go down much at the start.  Interest-only Your monthly payment pays only the interest charges on your loan - you don't pay off any of the loan amount (see Figure 2). This means your monthly payments will be less than if you had a repayment mortgage. However, the total cost of an interest-only mortgage will be higher because you will be paying interest on the full loan amount throughout the mortgage term.  With an interest-only mortgage, you will need to know from the start how you are going to find a lump sum to repay the loan at the end of the mortgage term. When you apply, we'll ask you to show us that you have a repayment plan(s) in place, to pay off everything that you owe at the end of the mortgage term. From time to time, we will ask you to show us that your repayment plan(s) remains on track to pay off everything you owe by the end of your mortgage term, and you must show us if we ask you. It’s important that you keep checking that your arrangements are still on track. If we think your plan may not be enough to repay everything you owe at the end of the term, we may contact you to discuss your plan and what can be done to put it right. For example you could consider transferring part, or all, of your loan onto a repayment mortgage. It’s your responsibility to make sure you have enough money to repay everything you owe at the end of your mortgage term. If your plan(s) does not give you enough money to repay everything you owe at the end of the term, you may have to sell your property. Interest-only mortgages are only available when the amount of loan is less than 75% of our latest valuation of the property.  Exclusive mortgage discount for Club Lloyds customers Our Club Lloyds current account customers could get a discount of 0.20% off their initial mortgage rate. How to get the discounted rate of 0.20% This offer applies to Club Lloyds current account customers who are: first time buyers remortgaging moving home switching to a new deal buying to let.  Keep in mind You must have a Club Lloyds current account open before you take out your mortgage. This includes our Silver and Platinum Club accounts. There is a £3 monthly fee to maintain the Club Lloyds current account, unless you pay in £2,000 or more each month. From 2 June 2025, we're increasing the Club Lloyds monthly fee to £5 per month. We'll continue to waive this for each month you pay in £2,000 or more. Offer can be changed or withdrawn at any time. Product conditions may apply. How much could you save? As an example, this could mean a total saving of £1,090.80 on a 5-year fixed-rate remortgage deal compared to a non-Club remortgage rate. This is based on an average remortgage amount of £162,000 payable over 25 years with an initial rate of 4.19%. An illustration of the monthly savings on a range of remortgage amounts are shown in the table right. This is based on a 0.20% Club Lloyds discount over the initial 5-year fixed period vs. non-Club rate. You can use our mortgage calculators to view our latest products and rates.  Representative example We show you this so you can see what a typical mortgage deal looks like. It doesn’t explain or change anything about your deal. A mortgage of £162,000 payable over 25 years, initially on a fixed rate for 5 years at 4.19% and then on our variable rate of 7.99% for the remaining 20 years, would require 60 monthly payments of £872.18 followed by 240 monthly payments of £1,249.27. The total amount payable would be £352,155.60 made up of the loan amount, plus interest of £190,155.60. The overall cost for comparison is 6.9% APRC representative. The amount we lend you is subject to a full mortgage application. Rates shown for remortgage only and are subject to change. Other rates apply to first time buyers and home movers.

Excludes buy to let applications, product transfers or if you’re borrowing more on your current Lloyds mortgage.  Whether you're a first time buyer or making your next move, we could help you find a mortgage to suit your needs.  Current Bank of England Base Rate The current Bank of England Base Rate is 4.5%.  How do base rate changes affect your mortgage repayments? When the base rate goes up, your mortgage repayments may go up. If it goes down, your mortgage repayments may go down. Whether the base rate impacts your mortgage repayments or not will depend on the type of mortgage that you’ve taken out: Fixed rate mortgage - A mortgage with a fixed interest rate for a set period. This means the base rate won't affect your rate when it goes up. But if the base rate goes down, you won’t pay any less. Tracker mortgage - Linked to the Base Rate. Your interest rate will change if the Base Rate goes up or down. This means your monthly payments can go up or down as well. Lender variable rate - A variable interest rate your rate reverts to when your current mortgage deal ends – unless you have agreed to a new deal. Your interest rate will go up or down if we change our lender variable rate.",
